ABOUT
-----------
This Drupal theme was created for the Maine Rural Partners website at mainerural.org.  It’s probably not too useful for others as-is, but feel free to poke around and steal some ideas (or suggest code improvements, if you’re really super nice like that).  If you want to contact us about anything you see here, your man is Lucas Sanders (lucas@mainerural.org).

We’re using the Less Framework 4 CSS grid (http://lessframework.com) atop the HTML5 markup provided by Boron (http://drupal.org/project/boron).  Remember to install Boron before using this theme.

All code is licensed under the GPL (http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-2.0), version 2 or any later version.  Maine Rural Partners reserves all rights to images in this repository unless otherwise stated.  Since the theme’s images are mostly limited to our organizational logos and branding, we don’t expect this policy to be an issue; but if you do want to use any of these images outside mainerural.org, please contact us to discuss licensing.
